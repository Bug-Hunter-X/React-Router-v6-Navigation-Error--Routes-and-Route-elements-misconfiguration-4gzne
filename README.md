# React Router v6 Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using React Router v6: incorrect nesting of `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components, leading to unexpected navigation behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the improper structuring of routes, resulting in a failure to render components correctly or handle navigation appropriately.

This example highlights the importance of following the correct nesting structure as defined in the React Router v6 documentation.
